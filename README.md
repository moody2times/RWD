# RWD
Responsive Web Design

This is a demo project to try and make a RWD. The design specifications I am attempting on mobile, tablet and desktop are as follows:

1. Mobile - access the menu using a hamburger menu button
2. Tablet - access the menu using a hamburger menu button 
3. Desktop - access the menu by using a navigation bar 

To achieve this, the menu should become hidden in mobile and tablet mode and become accessible only when the menu button is clicked. 
However, on desktop mode the menu bar should display on the navigation bar without the need for a button. 

The goal is to make this possible without using libraries like bootstrap for the functionality.
